# Information Retrieval Systems — Course Labs & Personal Projects

This repository began as a collection of lab assignments from my university's Information Retrieval Systems course. Over time, my interest in IR has grown, so I decided to continue expanding this repo with new personal projects, experiments, and re-implementations.

You will find both the original course labs (with my solutions) and additional projects that dive deeper into various information retrieval concepts.

## Focus Areas

My personal projects will explore a variety of theories, models, and ideas within the field of Information Retrieval, such as:

- Ranking models and scoring functions  
- Indexing structures and compression techniques  
- Query processing and optimization  
- Relevance feedback and evaluation metrics  
- Vector space & probabilistic models  
- Learning-to-rank approaches  
- IR system design and large-scale architectures  

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by course.  
Each course folder contains:

- A set of **lab directories**, each with the required work and my solution.  
- Additional **personal projects** that expand on IR-related topics and theories.  

Depending on the problem, the chosen technology, and the required environment, I will use appropriate **virtualization or isolation methods** (such as containers or virtual environments) to ensure reproducibility and ease of experimentation.
